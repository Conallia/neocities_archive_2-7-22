	<h1>30th of June 2022</h1>
	<main>

		<div class="textbox">
			<p>time: 00:00</p>
			<p>mood: relaxed</p>
			<p>eating: stolen chocolates</p>
			<p>Went with a friend to a light show, it was pretty cool, maybe I'll show some photos later. Although at the end walking back I felt kinda sick. Probably because of all the strange music they played.</p>
			<p>I love how when talking to others on here I don't have to explain what certain things are. Like I can just start talking about Linux or conlangs and everyone just knows what they are.</p>
			<p>Everyone on here seems to like the anime "Lain". It looks interesting so perhaps I'll watch it.</p>
			<p>Anywaysss, signing off---</p>
